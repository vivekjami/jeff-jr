**Jeff Jr** is a Telegram bot that acts as a no-nonsense venture capitalist, guiding startup founders to refine their MVPs and revenue plans with blunt, constructive feedback. Built in just 15 hours, it demonstrates proficiency in Python, API integration, database management, and cloud deployment on free-tier platforms. Jeff Jr remembers user projects, asks tough questions, and provides actionable advice to stand out in the startup ecosystem.

## üéØ Project Goals
- **Mentor Developers**: Helps users build market-ready MVPs with direct, no-sugarcoating feedback.
- **Persistent Memory**: Stores user profiles and project details using SQLite or Supabase Postgres.
- **Unique Persona**: Delivers blunt yet professional critiques, informed by blockchain expertise.
- **Scalable Design**: Supports ~30 concurrent users on free-tier Railway or Render.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Highlights skills in Python, bot development, and AI integration.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Interactive Q&A**: Engages users via Telegram with probing questions (e.g., "What's your revenue model? Be specific!").
- **Blunt Yet Polite Tone**: Challenges ideas firmly but professionally (e.g., "Your plan needs clarity. What's your edge?").
- **Project Memory**: Saves project details (name, stage, revenue goals) in a database.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses Hugging Face‚Äôs free Inference API for context-aware replies.
- **Review Command**: View saved project details with `/review`.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Runs 24/7 on Railway or Render‚Äôs free tier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language.
- **python-telegram-bot**: Asynchronous library for Telegram Bot API.
- **SQLite/Supabase Postgres**: Persistent storage for user and project data.
- **Hugging Face Inference API**: Free-tier conversational AI.
- **Railway/Render**: Free-tier hosting for continuous operation.
- **dotenv**: Secure management of API keys.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed.
- Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
- Hugging Face API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
- (Optional) Supabase account for Postgres database.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivek-jami/jeff-jr
   cd jeff-jr
   ```
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file:
     ```bash
     echo -e "TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token\nHF_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key\nDATABASE_URL=sqlite:///projects.db" > .env
     ```
   - Replace `your_telegram_bot_token` with your @JeffJrBot token.
   - Replace `your_hugging_face_api_key` with your Hugging Face API key.
   - For Supabase Postgres, update `DATABASE_URL` with the provided connection string.

4. **Initialize the Database**:
   - SQLite auto-creates `projects.db` on first run.
   - For Supabase, configure the Postgres connection (see deployment steps).

5. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
   Find `@JeffJrBot` on Telegram and start with `/start`.

## üåü Usage
- **Start**: Use `/start` to describe your project.
- **Provide Details**: Answer prompts about project name, stage, and revenue goals.
- **Review**: Use `/review` to view saved project details.
- **Get Feedback**: Receive blunt, actionable advice (e.g., "Your revenue plan is weak. How will you scale?").

### Example Interaction
**User**: `/start`  
**Jeff Jr**: Welcome to Jeff Jr, your AI VC coach! üòé What's your project name? Be clear!  
**User**: CryptoWallet  
**Jeff Jr**: CryptoWallet, huh? Alright:  
- What stage is it at? (Idea, Development, Launched)  
**User**: Idea  
**Jeff Jr**: An idea-stage crypto wallet? Noted. What's your revenue goal? Be specific or I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre not serious!  
**User**: $10K/month via transaction fees  
**Jeff Jr**: Saved. A crypto wallet with transaction fees? Let‚Äôs dig in:  
- What‚Äôs your unique edge over MetaMask?  
- Have you audited your smart contracts?  
- How will you attract your first 100 users?  
**User**: `/review`  
**Jeff Jr**: Here's your project:  
- Name: CryptoWallet  
- Stage: Idea  
- Revenue Goal: $10K/month via transaction fees  
Need to refine it? Type `/start` or ask away!

## ÔøΩ Œ†œÅŒø Deployment
Deploy Jeff Jr on **Railway** or **Render** for 24/7 operation:
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/vivek-jami/jeff-jr.git
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Railway Deployment**:
   - Sign up at [Railway](https://railway.app/).
   - Create a new project, link your GitHub repo, and select the `jeff-jr` repository.
   - Set environment variables: `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `HF_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (use `sqlite:///projects.db` or Supabase Postgres URL).
   - Set start command: `python bot.py`.
   - Deploy and check logs.

3. **Render Deployment** (Alternative):
   - Sign up at [Render](https://render.com/).
   - Create a new Web Service, connect your GitHub repo, and select Python runtime.
   - Set start command: `python bot.py`.
   - Add environment variables: `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `HF_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`.
   - Note: Render‚Äôs filesystem is ephemeral; use Supabase Postgres for persistence.
   - Deploy and monitor logs.

## üèÜ Developer Skills Showcased
