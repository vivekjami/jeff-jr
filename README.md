## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed.
- Telegram account and bot token from [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
- Hugging Face account and API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivek-jami/jeff-jr
   cd jeff-jr
   ```
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```bash
     TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
     HF_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
     ```
   - Replace `your_telegram_bot_token` with the token from BotFather.
   - Replace `your_hugging_face_api_key` with your Hugging Face API key.

4. **Initialize the Database**:
   - The bot auto-creates an SQLite database (`projects.db`) on first run.
   - For Heroku deployment, use Heroku Postgres (see deployment steps).

5. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
   Search for `@JeffJrBot` on Telegram and start with `/start`.

## üåü Usage
- **Start Interaction**: Use `/start` to begin describing your project.
- **Provide Details**: Answer prompts about your project name, stage, and revenue goals.
- **Review Projects**: Use `/review` to view saved project details.
- **Get Feedback**: Receive blunt, constructive advice to refine your MVP (e.g., "Your revenue plan is weak. How will you scale?").
